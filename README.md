# List Filtering Using Control Bar Controls
Demonstration of filtering a list control using items in a control bar.

## Demonstration Features

A common use case with an Alpha Anywhere UX component is searching a set of data records in a list control.  The Alpha Anywhere list control has built in searching capabilities.  It also has Action Javascript and pre-made buttons to support this function.

In this demonstration, we have created three "items" in the control bar.

* A text item to hold the search parameter.
* A button to trigger the search.
* A button to clear the search.

There is a list control with the search functionality enabled that performs the actual search and display.

# IMPORTANT
The demonstration relies on the use of the built in AADemo-Northwind connection string and included access database.  Please make sure you have created the connection string before executing this demonstration.
